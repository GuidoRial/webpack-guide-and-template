Then you want to add your dependencies with: \"npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli style-loader css-loader webpack-merge webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin\" 3. Create a dist folder and a src folder 4. On the src folder add webpack.common.js, webpack.dev.js and webpack.prod.js and paste the preset I provided 5. Add the two scripts I left in my package.json to change from dev (npm start) to production (npm run build) with the command line 6. Create a template.html and add anything you need to hard-code on your project, that'll be rendered to dist/index.html when you're done 7. Start writting your code on JS and CSS (don't forget to import/export whatever you need, in this repository I left an example on how to do it) 8. Everything should be routed to index.js",
